# tools_edmz

This repo contains: 
- notebooks for analysis of experiments
- useful snippets of code
- insight in the functionalities
This tools are currently developed, i'll try to keep track of what's deprecated, in a separate folder.

Currently, functionalities are implememted with the `tools_edmz` package but may later be done using the ClearMap 2.1 API

To be done

Install `ClearMapUi` (we may write a script to install minimal components required for analysis)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:doumazane/icm_toolbox.git
##
conda install -c conda-forge jupyter jupyter_contrib_nbextensions cached_property numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```
